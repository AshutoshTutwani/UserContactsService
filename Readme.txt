There are 2 solutions (WPF and Web API) inside this repo,
which should be run separately.

First solution is under Contact.API folder.
Open the solution and rebuilt the API // if it does not build then restore the NuGet packages
Start the web API on port 5000.

Second solution is under WPFContactApp folder.
Open the solution and run the WPF app.
