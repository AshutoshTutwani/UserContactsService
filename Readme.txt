There are 2 solutions (WPF and Web API) inside this repo,
which should be run separately.

First solution is under Contact.API folder.
It has 3 projects (Contact.API, Contact.Domain and Contact.Tests)
Open the solution and rebuilt the whole solution // if it does not build then restore the NuGet packages
You can run all the tests or Start the web API on port 5000 thorugh inbuil Kestrel server.

Second solution is under WPFContactApp folder.
Open the solution and run the WPF app.

In case of any doubts or issues, then contact me on my email ashutoshtutwani@gmail.com
